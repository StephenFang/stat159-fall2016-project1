#Conclusion

Hopefully the sections above give you a sense of what these tool are and how to utilize these tools in a reproducible workflow. I hope you find it useful! I also have some personal feelings to share with you:

For this project, I read some articles online introducing Git, Makefile, Markdown, Pandoc and GitHub in order to get a more formal sense of the tool so that I can explain what these tools are with accuracy in my own words later. The "easy" part of this project is setting up the directories and downloading the logos from Professor's github repo. The more challenging parts are writing the paper and readme because I have to think in advance so that others will be able to reproduce this project with reasonable guidance. For me, I would say the most time consuming part is writing the papers because you really want to make sure you are using the right examples and explaining the concept clearly enough. For this project, I worked on it on my own and it took me around 6 hours.
