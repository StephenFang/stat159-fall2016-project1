#Abstract

For this paper, we are going to walk through some tools that will help us in the reporducible workflow, which are:

- Makefile
- Git
- GitHub
- Pandoc
- Markdown

It is essential and important to have these tools because they together create a collborative environment for users and therefore speed up the work process. For the following chapters, we are going to introduce these tools in general and also point out how they could be useful for our use case.
